## Description
The backend API for Joker, an online social game built with Go. Powered by Gin, sqlc, and WebSocket, this API handles real-time gameplay, player interactions, and game state management. Designed for scalability and seamless multiplayer experiences.



## "Why?" 
I've always been fascinated by social games after playing offline party games like "È¨ºÁâå" (a German social deduction game) with friends. These games create amazing moments of connection and laughter, but I noticed a common problem: we'd often run out of interesting questions or prompts, which would kill the momentum.

So I built this backend system that provides a flexible, extensible question database with real-time capabilities. 



## üöÄ Quick Start

Navigate to [joker.jienian.tw](https://joker.jienian.tw) and start your social game!

Create rooms, add questions, and play with friends instantly.
